### Open source ###
Microsoft's announcements on nov. 16 2016, groundbreaking yet not surprising, regarding [SQL Server version running on Linux](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/dataplatforminsider/2016/11/16/announcing-sql-server-on-linux-public-preview-first-preview-of-next-release-of-sql-server/), and [joining the Linux faundation](https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/16/microsoft-joins-the-linux-foundation/) as a Platinium member, reveales the massive impact of open source projects on software engineering world - open source is around for more than 30 years, and it can't be ignored anymore.

We, SQL Server DBA's and developers, as Microsoft's software developement tools users, have to understand the meaning of Microsoft's new attitude towards open source code, adapt ourseleves to this change, and open our minds to new ideas, concepts and tools, arriving from the open source direction.

As a SQL Server DBA and developer, raised on Microsoft technologies, I understand the difficulties associated with adjusting to open source tools and concepts. This is one of the main reasons I started this blog, to give you an easy entry point, by sharing examples and best practices from my and other leading bloggers experience. 

The adjustment process takes time, practice and patience, but trust me, it's worth the effort and time you invest. The more comfort you become with those tools and concepts, the more you will discover their awsemness, how they colaborate together, helping you with cross platform heavy lifting duties.


### DevOps ###
DevOps is a concept for ongoing improvement of software developement process. The term was established back in 2008 Agile conference, and popularized through series of DevOps days starting 2009. Many of the DevOp tools are open sourced, and many of DevOps concepts come from Linux world.

At this point you probably ask yourself, OK, nice introduction, but what all of this, got to do with SQL Server ?
Well, from my point of view, database developement projects, are not different from other software developement projects. If you write code, build, test and deploy it, you actually experience the same chalanges and difficulties that software developers experience, so why shouldn't you enjoy the huge benefits of DevOps.

There are some great SQL Server professional sites on the web, dealing with SQL Server DevOps issues, non of them cover the subject as a whole. In this blog, I intend to cover the full scope of DevOps from the prespective of the SQL Server database DBA and developer.

This blog was a short preface and introduction, the next blog will start diving into more technical stuff,  stay tuned!
